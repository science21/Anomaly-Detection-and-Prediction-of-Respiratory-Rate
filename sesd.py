    Compute the Seasonal Extreme Studentized Deviate of a time series.
    The steps taken are first to to decompose the time series into STL
    decomposition (trend, seasonality, residual). Then, calculate
    the Median Absolute Deviate (MAD) if hybrid (otherwise the median)
    and perform a regular ESD test on the residual, which we calculate as:

    Note: The statsmodel library requires a seasonality to compute the STL
    decomposition, hence the parameter seasonality. If none is given,
    then it will automatically be calculated to be 20% of the total
    timeseries.
